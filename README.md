# Adventure Game – Wwise Audio Rebuild (Final Project)

## Overview
This project is my **final assignment** for the Wwise audio implementation course.  
The goal of this project is to **recreate the full audio experience** for the Audiokinetic *Adventure Game* sample using a brand-new Wwise project built entirely from scratch.  

Rather than using the prebuilt sample, I am rebuilding every major audio component — including events, busses, music systems, and real-time logic — to demonstrate a complete understanding of Wwise workflows and interactive audio design.

## Project Description
The *Adventure Game* sample showcases a variety of gameplay scenarios, each with dynamic sound design, environmental audio, and adaptive music systems.  
For this final, I’m responsible for rebuilding the game’s entire audio structure using the provided sound files and the reference Wwise project as a design guide.

Within my own Wwise project, I’ll recreate:
- Gameplay sound effects and event structures  
- 3D spatial audio through attenuation and positioning  
- Environmental reverb, auxiliary busses, and mixing  
- Switches, States, and RTPCs for real-time audio control  
- Interactive music transitions and intensity layers  

## Objectives
1. **Demonstrate mastery of Wwise authoring tools** — including Events, Busses, Work Units, RTPCs, and interactive music systems.  
2. **Recreate adaptive audio behavior** that dynamically responds to gameplay actions and environmental changes.  
3. **Design an organized and efficient project structure** suitable for real-world audio production.  
4. **Show practical understanding of implementation logic**, using Wwise’s hierarchy and parameter-driven systems.  
5. **Develop consistent workflow habits** for cross-machine collaboration (using version control and clean project management).  

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I’m learning how to:
- Rebuild and connect complex audio systems from a reference design  
- Translate gameplay and environmental cues into interactive audio logic  
- Organize professional Wwise projects for long-term scalability  
- Work collaboratively or independently across multiple workstations without loss of progress  

## Final Notes
This project represents the culmination of everything learned in the course — from basic event creation to advanced audio logic and adaptive music systems.  
By the end of this project, I will have a **fully functional, rebuilt version** of the Adventure Game’s audio implementation, designed and structured entirely within my own Wwise project.
